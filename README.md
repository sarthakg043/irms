# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh


Get code:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarthakg043/irms
```

For contribution, fork the repo and clone the fork then move into the root of project folder and install dependencies by following commands:

```bash
npm install
```
Run in dev mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

Build command:
```bash

```
